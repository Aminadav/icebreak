# Points System Implementation Summary

## What was implemented:

### Backend:
1. **Socket Handler** - `/backend/routes/socket-handlers/getMyPoints.js`
   - New socket event `my_points` that responds with user points using callback
   - Validates user authentication and game ID
   - Gets/creates user points from `user_points` table
   - Security: Uses `getUserIdFromDevice()` to prevent client tampering

2. **Socket Integration**
   - Added `handleGetMyPoints` to socket handlers index
   - Registered `my_points` event in main socket.js
   - Added to exports in socket-handlers/index.js

3. **Database**
   - Uses existing `user_points` table (already exists from migration 002)
   - Points are per user per game
   - Defaults to 0 points if no record exists

### Frontend:
1. **GameContext** - `/frontend/src/contexts/GameContext.tsx`
   - New React context that manages game state and user points
   - Provides `useGame()` and `usePoints()` hooks
   - Automatically loads points when user and game are available
   - Listens for points updates from server

2. **GameRouter** - Updated to use GameProvider
   - Wraps routes with GameProvider
   - Simplified component structure
   - Removed prop passing, uses context instead

3. **BeforeStartAskAboutYou** - Updated to use hooks
   - Uses `usePoints()` hook to get current points
   - No longer needs points passed as props
   - Displays real user points via MyPoints component

4. **MyPoints Component** - Already existed, no changes needed
   - Receives points from parent and displays them

## How it works:

1. **GameRouter** wraps all routes with **GameProvider**
2. **GameProvider** manages all game state including points
3. When user + game data is available, **GameProvider** automatically calls `my_points` socket event
4. **BeforeStartAskAboutYou** uses `usePoints()` to get current points
5. Points are displayed via **MyPoints** component
6. Points auto-update when server sends `points_updated` events

## Usage in any component:
```tsx
import { usePoints } from '../contexts/GameContext';

function MyComponent() {
  const { points, refreshPoints } = usePoints();
  return <div>Current points: {points}</div>;
}
```

## Socket Events:
- **Client → Server**: `my_points` with `{ gameId }` 
- **Server → Client**: Callback with `{ success: true, points: number }`
- **Server → Client**: `points_updated` event for real-time updates

The implementation is complete and follows the requirements:
✅ New `my_points` socket event with callback
✅ GameProvider context for accessing points
✅ `usePoints()` hook for any component
✅ Real points data instead of hardcoded values
✅ Automatic loading and updates
