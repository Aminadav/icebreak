export const summaryEn = `IceBreak is an innovative Israeli game (2025). It was born from a desire to strengthen meaningful connections between people who are already around us, in the neighborhood, community, or family. It was built from personal experience, in collaboration with community managers, educators, and user experience experts, to turn every group into a cohesive community. The game is suitable for everyone - children, adults, couples, and friends - and is based on carefully selected questions for emotional connection. This is a non-profit project, built with love and attention to every detail, with a simple hope: that we will talk more, deepen, and feel together.`;
